Be sure to wrap predicates within parentheses to control precedence.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nWHERE \n(\nactor.name \n=\n \njohn doe\n OR movie.rating \n \n8\n.8\n)\n AND movie.votes \n=\n \n250\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE actor.age \n=\n director.age AND actor.age \n \n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to specify equality predicates within nodes and edges using the curly braces as such:\n\n\n(\n:president \n{\nname:\nBarack Obama\n})\n-\n[\n:won \n{\nterm:2\n}]\n-\n(\n:state\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we've required that the president node's name will have the value \"Barack Obama\"\nand the won edge term property will equal 2.\n\n\nThere's no difference between inlined predicates and predicates specified within the WHERE clause.\n\n\nRETURN\n\n\nIn its simple form, Return defines which properties the returned result-set will contain.\nIts structure is a list of \nalias.property\n seperated by commas.\nFor convenience, it's possible to specify the alias only when you're interested in every attribute an entity possesses,\nand don't want to specify each attribute individually. e.g.\n\n\nRETURN movie.title, actor\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the DISTINCT keyword to remove duplications within the result-set:\n\n\nRETURN DISTINCT friend_of_friend.name\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, suppose we have two friends, Joe and Miesha,\nand both know Dominick. Then DISTINCT will make sure that Dominick will only appear once\nin the final result-set.\n\n\nReturn can also be used to aggregate data similar to SQL group by. Once an aggregation function is added to the return\nlist, all other \"none\" aggregated values are considered as group keys, for example:\n\n\nRETURN movie.title, MAX\n(\nactor.age\n)\n, MIN\n(\nactor.age\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we group data by movie title and for each movie, we find its youngest and oldest actor age.\n\n\nAggregations\n\n\nSupported aggregation functions:\n\n\n\n\nsum\n\n\navg\n\n\nmin\n\n\nmax\n\n\ncount\n\n\n\n\nORDER BY\n\n\nSpecifies that the output should be sorted and how.\n\n\nYou can order by multiple properties by stating each variable in the ORDER BY clause.\nThe result will be sorted by the first variable listed, and for equal values, go to the next property in the ORDER BY\nclause, and so on.\n\n\nORDER BY \nalias.property list\n \n[\nASC/DESC\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow we sort our friends by height. For similar heights, weight is used to break even.\n\n\nORDER BY friend.height, friend.weight DESC\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMIT\n\n\nAlthough not mandatory, in order to limit the number of records returned by a query, you can\nuse the limit clause:\n\n\nLIMIT \nmax records to \nreturn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not specified, there's no limit to the number of records returned by a query.\n\n\nCREATE\n\n\nCREATE query is used to introduce new nodes and relationships.\nThe simplest example of CREATE would be a single node creation:\n\n\nCREATE \n(\nn\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's possible to create multiple entities by seperating them with a comma.\n\n\nCREATE \n(\nn\n)\n,\n(\nm\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel and properties can be specified at creation time\n\n\nCREATE \n(\n:person \n{\nname: Kurt, age:27\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding relations between nodes, in the following example we first locate an existing source node,\nonce found we create a new relationship and destination node.\n\n\nMATCH\n(\na:person\n)\n\nWHEREE a.name \n=\n \nKurt\n\nCREATE \n(\na\n)\n-\n[\nmember \n{\nposition:\nlead singer\n}]\n-\n(\n:band \n{\nname:Nirvana\n})\n\nRETURN\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the source node is a bounded node while the destination node is unbounded,\nas a result a new node is created representing the band Nirvana and a new relation connects Kurt as the lead singer of the band.\n\n\nLastly we'll create a complete pattern, all entities within the pattern which are not bounded will be created.\n\n\nCREATE \n\n(\njim:person\n{\nname:\nJim\n, age:29\n})\n-\n[\nfriends\n]\n-\n(\npam:person \n{\nname:\nPam\n, age:27\n})\n-\n[\nworks\n]\n-\n(\n:employer \n{\nname:\nDunder Mifflin\n})\n\nRETURN\n\n\n\n\n\nThis query will create three nodes and two relationships.\n\n\nDELETE\n\n\nDELETE query is used to remove both nodes and relationships, please remember that deleting a node will also delete\nall of its incoming and outgoing relationships.\n\n\nDelete a node and all of its relationships:\n\n\nMATCH \n(\np:person \n{\nname:\nJim\n})\n\nDELETE p\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete a relationship\n\n\nMATCH \n(\np:person \n{\nname:\nJim\n})\n-\n[\nr:friends\n]\n-\n()\n\nDELETE r\n\n\n\n\n\nThis query will delete all \nfriend\n outgoing relationships from the node with the name 'Jim'.\n\n\nSET\n\n\nThe \nSET\n clause is used to update properties on nodes and relationships.\n\n\nTo set a property on a node or relationship, use \nSET\n.\n\n\nQuery.\n\n\nMATCH \n(\nn \n{\n name: \nJim\n \n})\n SET n.name \n=\n \nBob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet multiple properties using one \nSET\n clause\nIf you want to set multiple properties in one go, simply separate them with a comma.\n\n\nQuery.\n\n\nMATCH \n(\nn \n{\n name: \nJim\n, age:32 \n})\n\nSET n.age \n=\n \n33\n, n.name \n=\n \nBob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\nThis section contains information on all supported functions from the OpenCypher query language.\n\n\n\n\nAggregating functions\n\n\nMathematical functions\n\n\nString functions\n\n\n\n\nAggregating functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\navg()\n\n\nReturns the average of a set of numeric values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount()\n\n\nReturns the number of values or rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax()\n\n\nReturns the maximum value in a set of values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin()\n\n\nReturns the minimum value in a set of values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum()\n\n\nReturns the sum of a set of numeric values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabs()\n\n\nReturns the absolute value of a number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nceil()\n\n\nReturns the smallest floating point number that is greater than or equal to a number and equal to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfloor()\n\n\nReturns the largest floating point number that is less than or equal to a number and equal to a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrand()\n\n\nReturns a random floating point number in the range from 0 to 1;

Some use adjacency list, others might use\nan adjacency matrix. Each structure has its advantages and disadvantages. For RedisGraph it was crucial to find a data\nstructure which will enable us to perform fast searches on the graph, and thus we have decided to use a concept called\n\nHexastore\n in order to hold all the relationships within the graph.\n\n\nGraph representation: Hexastore\n\n\nA Hexastore is simply a list of triplets, where each triplet is composed of three parts:\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nPredicate\n\n\nObject\n\n\n\n\nWhere the Subject refers to a source node, predicate represents a relationship and the object refers to a destination\nnode.\nFor each relationship within the graph our hexastore will contain all six permutation of the source node, relationship\nedge and destination node.\nFor example consider the following relation:\n\n\n(Aldis_Hodge)-[act]-\n(Straight_Outta_Compton)\n\n\nwhere:\n- Aldis_Hodge is the source node\n- act is the relationship\n- Straight_Outta_Compton is the destination node\n\n\nAll six possibilities of representing this connection are as follows:\n\n\nSPO:Aldis_Hodge:act:Straight_Outta_Compton\nSOP:Aldis_Hodge:Straight_Outta_Compton:act\nPOS:act:Straight_Outta_Compton:Aldis_Hodge\nPSO:act:Aldis_Hodge:Straight_Outta_Compton\nOPS:Straight_Outta_Compton:act:Aldis_Hodge\nOSP:Straight_Outta_Compton:Aldis_Hodge:act\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Hexastore constructed we can easily search our graph, suppose I would like to find the cast of the movie\nStraight Outta Compton, all I've to do is search my Hexastore for all strings containing the\nprefix: \nOPS:Straight_Outta_Compton:act:*\n\n\nOr if I'm interested in all the movies Aldis Hodge played in, I can search for all strings containing the\nprefix: \nSPO:Aldis_Hodge:act:*\n\n\nAlthough a Hexastore uses plenty of memory (six triplets for each relation), we're using a trie data structure which is\nnot only fast in terms of search but is also memory efficient as it doesn't create duplication of string prefixes it\nalready seen.\n\n\nQuery language: openCypher\n\n\nThere are a number of Graph Query languages, we didn't want to reinvent the wheel and come up with our own language,\nand so we've decided to implement a subset of one of the most popular graph query language out there openCypher.\nThe Open-Cypher project provides means to create a parser for the language, although convenient\nwe decided to create our own parser with Lex as a tokenizer and Lemon which generates a C target parser.\n\n\nAs mentioned only a subset of the language is supported, but it is our intention to continue adding new capabilities\nand extend the language.\n\n\nRuntime: query execution\n\n\nLet's review the steps our module takes when executing a query.\nConsider the following query which finds all actors who've played alongside Aldis Hodge and are over 30 years old:\n\n\nMATCH (aldis::actor {name:\nAldis Hodge\n})-[act]-\n(m:movie)\n-[act]-(a:actor) WHERE a.age \n 30 RETURN m.title, a.name\n\n\n\n\n\nRedisGraph will\n- Parse query, build abstract syntax tree (AST)\n- Construct a query execution plan composed of:\n  - Label scan operation\n  - Filter operation (filter tree)\n  - Expand operation\n  - Expand into operation\n- Execute plan\n- Populate result-set with matching entities attributes\n\n\nQuery parser\n\n\nGiven a valid query the parser will generate an AST containing six primary nodes one for each clause:\n\n\n\n\nMATCH\n\n\nCREATE\n\n\nDELETE\n\n\nWHERE\n\n\nRETURN\n\n\nORDER\n\n\n\n\nGenerating an abstract syntax tree is a common way of describing and structuring a language.\n\n\nFilter tree\n\n\nA query can filter out entities by creating predicates. In our example we're filtering actors which are younger then 30.\nIt's possible to combine predicates using the OR, AND keywords to form granular conditions. During runtime the WHERE\nclause is used to construct a filter tree. Each node within the tree is either a condition e.g. A \n B or an operation\n(AND/OR). When finding candidate entities they are passed through the tree and get evaluated.\n\n\nQuery processing\n\n\nThe MATCH clause describes relations between queried entities (nodes), a node can have an alias which will allow us to\nrefer to it at later stages within the executing query lifetime (WHERE, RETURN clause), but all nodes must eventually\nbe assign an ID. The process of assigning IDs to nodes is refered to as the search phase.\n\n\nDuring the search we'll be querying the Hexastore for IDs according to the MATCH clause structure.\nFor instance, in our example we'll start our search by looking for movies in which Aldis Hodge played in.\nFor each movie we'll extend our search to find out which other actors played in the current processed movie.\n\n\nAs you might imagine the search process is a recursive operation which traverse the graph. At each step a new ID is\ndiscovered. Once every node has an ID assigned to it we can be assured that current entities have passed our filters.\nAt this point we can extract requested attributes (as specified in the return clause) and append a new record to the\nfinal result set.\n\n\nBenchmarks\n\n\nDepending on the underlying hardware results may vary. That said, inserting a new relationship is done in O(1).\nRedisGraph is able to create 100K new relations within one second.\n\n\nRetrieving data really depends on the size of the graph and the type of query you're executing.\nOn a small size graph ~1000 entities and ~2500 edges, RedisGraph is able to perform ~65K friend of a friend query\nevery second.\n\n\nIt's worth mentioning that besides the hexastore, entities are not indexed. It\u2019s our intention to introduce entities\nindexing which should decrease query execution time dramatically.\n\n\nLicense\n\n\nRedis-Graph is published under AGPL-3.0.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAlthough RedisGraph is still a young project, it can be an alternative to other graph databases. With its subset of\noperations one can use it to analyze and explore its graph data. Being a Redis module this project is accessible from\nevery Redis client without the need to make any adjustments. It's our intention to keep on improving and extending\nRedisGraph with the help of the open source community.",

The process of assigning IDs to nodes is refered to as the search phase.  During the search we'll be querying the Hexastore for IDs according to the MATCH clause structure.\nFor instance, in our example we'll start our search by looking for movies in which Aldis Hodge played in.\nFor each movie we'll extend our search to find out which other actors played in the current processed movie.  As you might imagine the search process is a recursive operation which traverse the graph. At each step a new ID is\ndiscovered. Once every node has an ID assigned to it we can be assured that current entities have passed our filters.\nAt this point we can extract requested attributes (as specified in the return clause) and append a new record to the\nfinal result set.",
